### Document Outline  

Use semantic headings and structure  

> "Sections may contain headings of any rank, and authors are strongly encouraged to use headings of the appropriate rank for the section's nesting level"

Sections nested one level may begin with a `h2` heading, while top-level sections should begin with `h1` headings. To the extent possible, the headings should represent an accurate outline of the content.
