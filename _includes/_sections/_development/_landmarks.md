### Landmarks

ARIA Landmark Roles are helpful landmarks that can be used by Assistive Technologies to navigate a website.

- `<header role="banner">`  

    > “A region that contains mostly site-oriented content, rather than page-specific content.”  

    Generally the page header. Used only once per page.  

- `<nav role="navigation">`  

    > “A collection of navigational elements (usually links) for navigating the document or related documents.”  

    > “User agents SHOULD treat elements with the role of navigation as navigational landmarks.”  

- `<main role="main">`  

    > “The main content of a document.”  

    Used only once.  

- `<article role="article">`  

    > “A section of a page that consists of a composition that forms an independent part of a document, page, or site.”  

    Do not place articles within articles.  

- `<aside role="complementary">`  

    > “A supporting section of the document, designed to be complementary to the main content at a similar level in the DOM hierarchy, but remains meaningful when separated from the main content.”  

- `<footer role="contentinfo">`  

    > “A large perceivable region that contains information about the parent document.”  

- `<form role="search">`  

    > “A landmark region that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a search facility.”  

    Used on search forms.
