### `alt` text  

- Provide the alt attribute for images used as content to describe the function of the image (alt text is rarely detailed description).  

- Descriptions should be useful, i.e., "company name", not "logo".  

- Image links should describe where they go, not the image itself.  

- Use an empty alt attribute for decorative images, or images that not necessary for understanding the content of the page.
