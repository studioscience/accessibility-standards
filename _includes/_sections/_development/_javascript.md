### Javascript
- Use unobtrusive Javascript (never use inline scripting).  

	Unobtrusive JavaScript means the site and content should still be accessible with JavaScript disabled. JavaScript should be added in the spirit of Progressive Enhancement.

- Provide fallbacks for users with JavaScript disabled.  

    This is especially important for interactions, such as those using the `slideToggle()` method.
