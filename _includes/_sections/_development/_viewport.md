### Viewport  

- Never use `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0">`

    Using `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0">` can keep users with vision problems from accessing and/or understanding your site, by removing the ability to pinch and zoom. Use `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` instead, which causes the site to load at the correct size and zoom level, but still allows users to change the size of the content.
